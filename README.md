# Blog

This blog was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), an open source scientific and technical publishing system. Quarto uses [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), a file converter from one markup format to another.

Repositories:

- [Quarto Repositories](https://github.com/quarto-dev)

- [Pandoc Repository](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc)

Each post is written in Markdown format and converted to HTML. Additional information (metadata) about each post is provided in YAML format.

Before you start writing your first post, I recommend reading:
